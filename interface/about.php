<div style="padding:5px;" class="abox">
    This website is dedicated to my personal portfolio of projects I have done in the past.
    I am a developer I mainly develop in C#. I also use other languages like Javascript and php for web applications. Other languages I more rarely use are C++/C and python but I can write programs with them as well.
    Right now I am attending army as it is mandatory in my country and I will not be available before autumn 2017.
